**Thanks for visiting this repo.**

Our goal in this repository is to develop license systems, it is completely open source. My goal is to teach people, not money.

*Current systems*
-
License Servers;

	Example 1;
	* Node.JS -> Done 
	* PHP -> Not yet
	* PHP Detailed (Admin panel etc.)  -> Not yet
Programs;

	Example 1;
	* C++ -> Done (using Node.JS)
	* C# (Console) -> Done (using Node.JS)
	* C# (Form) -> Done (using Node.JS)

#  #TODO

 1. Using crypto services.
 2. A little reverse engineering protection.
 3. XOR (String encoding)
 4. Source code confusing.
 5. Background services.
 6. Licenses with a duration.

**Stay follow!**
